# what it does

translates your incoming text a few times (or more) to make it drunk\
it is the same as putting a plagiarised essay into google translate multiple times and getting a brand new different essay

# how to use

* 0.1: have some basic knowledge in python and lua, i mean it
* 0.2: have python 3.10 (recommended version) installed
* 0.3: install packages via `py -3.10 -m pip install translate translate-api Flask` or `pip3 install translate translate-api Flask`
* 1: run main.py first
* 2: in the python console, it should display a http link once you run main.py. copy that and replace the one provided in the lua script at line 21. (if theres two http links try both)
* 3: then run main.lua in your executor, can work with free ones and paid ones
* 4: talk in chat and it will work

if you run into issues feel free to dm me Nexity#3200 though i wont be hand holding you on how to use it
