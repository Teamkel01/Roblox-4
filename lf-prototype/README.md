# tutorial
you know youre doing something wrong when other people dont know how to use it\
\
if you want to render yourself, you have to have python 3\
pip3 install opencv-python\
pip3 install moviepy\
pip3 install Pillow\
\
here rendering your own video\
1. variables are lf-prototype.py, input.mp4, and frames.txt
2. you have input.mp4, which is the video you choose to play
3. when you run lf-prototype.py, it will create a frames.txt that you rename to something like videoname1.txt and put into your executor workspace
4. you take the lf-prototype.lua and change line 40 local response = readfile("rickroll1.txt") change the .txt to the frames.txt name
4. or if you are using the gui version, put the frames.txt into /workspace/frames/ instead of just /workspace and type the name of the txt and press enter
5. it will start playing the video
\
here prerendered video if you dont feel like rendering your own video\
put these in /workspace/frames/ in your executor folder\
